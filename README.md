# Cellular Automata
Web app for displaying one-dimensional cellular automata, lets you animate and also save an image.

The rules are from [The Wolfram Atlas](http://atlas.wolfram.com/TOC/TOC_200.html)

This was created by [@Ellyll](https://twitter.com/Ellyll) who was inspired by Irina Shestak [@_lrlna](https://twitter.com/_lrlna) and Mattias P Johansson [@mpjme](https://twitter.com/mpjme),
and their YouTube video [Cellular Automata - Pair Programming - FunFunFunction #49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk&t=2603s)

There are Twitter bots that post images on:
* [@CellularAuto](https://twitter.com/CellularAuto) - English
* [@AwtomataCellog](https://twitter.com/AwtomataCellog) - Cymraeg (Welsh)

Icons are based on those from [Gemoicons](http://geomicons.com/) and [Language Icon](http://www.languageicon.org/), thanks!

## TODO:
* add info/about, including links to http://atlas.wolfram.com
* add share icon/functionality
* add options to choose rule etc. ?
* tidy up code
